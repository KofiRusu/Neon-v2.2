| ContentAgent  | Generates posts, captions, emails, and product copy                | Content creation, A/B testing, platform optimization           |
| AdAgent       | Runs A/B tests, reallocates budgets, optimizes creative            | Ad performance, budget management, creative optimization       |
| OutreachAgent | Sends personalized B2B emails, manages follow-up chains            | Lead nurturing, email sequences, follow-up automation          |
| TrendAgent    | Detects viral content, trending sounds, and global style shifts    | Trend detection, viral content identification, market analysis |
| InsightAgent  | Monitors analytics to propose strategy shifts                      | Data analysis, strategy recommendations, performance insights  |
| DesignAgent   | Creates and tests new sign designs based on user inputs and trends | Design generation, visual testing, product innovation          |

**Agent Architecture**:

```typescript
interface BaseAgent {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  capabilities: string[];
  execute(payload: AgentPayload): Promise<AgentResult>;
  getStatus(): AgentStatus;
}

interface AgentPayload {
  task: string;
  context: Record<string, any>;
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  deadline?: Date;
}
```

### 3. Campaign Engine

**Location**: `packages/reasoning-engine/`

### 4. Data & Analytics Core

**Location**: `packages/data-model/`

Centralized database (PostgreSQL via Prisma) with logs for:

- Campaign stats
- Behavioral data
- AI decisions
- Machine learning feedback loop to retrain models

**Database Schema Highlights**:

```prisma
model Campaign {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  name        String
  type        CampaignType
  status      CampaignStatus
  metrics     Json
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
}

model AgentExecution {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  agentId     String
  task        String
  result      Json
  performance Float
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
}
```

### 5. Global Outreach Engine

**Location**: `packages/core-agents/outreach/`

- Lead scraper & enrichment tool (LinkedIn, directories)
- Auto-email sequencer
- Language/localization module (multilingual personalization)

### 6. User Experience Personalization

**Location**: `packages/reasoning-engine/personalization/`

Tracks:

- Browsing/cart actions
- Purchase behavior
- Interaction with ads or DMs

Adjusts:

- Prices, discounts, content shown
- Retargeting ads or SMS flows

### 7. Product Innovation Lab

**Location**: `apps/dashboard/innovation/`

- "Request-a-sign" user funnel
- AI-generated visual prototypes
- A/B tested previews and sales predictions
- Instant publish to store

### 8. Trend & Market Heatmap (Global Intelligence Engine)

**Location**: `packages/reasoning-engine/trends/`

- Scrapes demand signals across platforms
- Shows region-by-region heatmap + viral potential
- Offers data-backed suggestions to the Command Dashboard

### 9. Retail Activation Toolkit

**Location**: `apps/dashboard/retail/`
