# NeonHub AI Marketing Ecosystem - Complete Backend Audit Prompt

## MISSION BRIEF
You are conducting a comprehensive backend audit of the NeonHub AI Marketing Ecosystem - a production-ready, AI-first autonomous marketing and sales platform designed for global brand scale. Your task is to analyze the entire codebase, identify implementation gaps, and provide a complete roadmap to 100% production readiness.

## SYSTEM CONTEXT
**Core Agent Architecture:**
- ContentAgent (SEO optimization, blog generation, social captions)
- SocialAgent (social media posts, community replies, engagement)
- EmailAgent (email sequences, cold outreach campaigns)
- CustomerSupportAgent (inbox management, WhatsApp/Twilio integration)
- TrendAgent (market trend prediction, competitive analysis)
- OutreachAgent (B2B lead generation, prospect qualification)
- AnalyticsAgent (KPI tracking, ROI insights, performance metrics)

**Tech Stack:**
- Backend: Node.js/TypeScript with tRPC API
- Frontend: Next.js with Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- Database: Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
- AI Integration: OpenAI/Claude agent orchestration
- Architecture: Monorepo with GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Production UI: Located in `/Neon-v2.3.3/src/app/`

## AUDIT EXECUTION PLAN

### Phase 1: üìÅ Directory Structure Analysis
**Execute these steps:**

1. **Map the complete project architecture:**
   - Use `list_dir` to explore `/packages/core-agents/src/` and catalog all agent implementations
   - Analyze `/apps/api/src/routers/` for all tRPC route definitions
   - Survey `/Neon-v2.3.3/src/app/` for all frontend page implementations
   - Examine `/packages/data-model/prisma/` for database schema completeness

2. **Identify agent implementation status:**
   - Use `codebase_search` with queries like "How is ContentAgent implemented?" for each core agent
   - Use `grep_search` to find agent class definitions and their methods
   - Check for base agent inheritance patterns and shared functionality

3. **Database schema validation:**
   - Read the complete Prisma schema to understand data models
   - Verify agent-specific tables and relationships exist
   - Check for proper indexing and constraints

### Phase 2: üîå API + Agent Coverage Mapping
**Execute these steps:**

1. **tRPC Router Analysis:**
   - Use `codebase_search` to find "How are tRPC routes organized?"
   - Map each agent to its corresponding API endpoints
   - Verify input/output types and validation schemas
   - Check for proper error handling and authentication

2. **Agent Service Integration:**
   - Search for "How do agents communicate with each other?"
   - Analyze agent orchestration and workflow patterns
   - Verify OpenAI/Claude integration points
   - Check for rate limiting and cost management

3. **Frontend-Backend Connection:**
   - Use `codebase_search` with "How does frontend call backend APIs?"
   - Map each UI page to its corresponding API calls
   - Verify proper data flow and state management
   - Check for loading states and error handling

### Phase 3: üß† Implementation Gap Analysis
**Execute these steps:**

1. **Agent Logic Completeness:**
   - For each core agent, search for actual implementation vs. stub code
   - Use queries like "What methods does ContentAgent actually implement?"
   - Check for TODO comments, placeholder functions, or empty implementations
   - Verify AI model integration and prompt engineering

2. **End-to-End Flow Verification:**
   - Trace complete user workflows from UI ‚Üí API ‚Üí Agent ‚Üí Database
   - Search for "How does user create a campaign?" and similar flows
   - Verify data persistence and retrieval patterns
   - Check for proper validation and sanitization

3. **Feature Completeness Check:**
   - Compare implemented features against the core capabilities list
   - Search for missing integrations (WhatsApp, Twilio, social platforms)
   - Verify analytics and reporting functionality
   - Check for proper scheduling and automation features

### Phase 4: üß™ Test Coverage & Quality Analysis
**Execute these steps:**

1. **Test Suite Analysis:**
   - Use `file_search` to find all test files (*.test.ts, *.spec.ts)
   - Analyze test coverage for each agent and API endpoint
   - Check for integration tests and E2E scenarios
   - Verify mock implementations and test data

2. **Code Quality Assessment:**
   - Search for error handling patterns and consistency
   - Check for proper TypeScript typing and interfaces
   - Verify logging and monitoring implementations
   - Analyze performance considerations and optimizations

### Phase 5: üìä Generate Comprehensive Report

**Create a structured report with these sections:**
