### **Step 5: Reintegration Process**

#### 📥 **Import Back to NeonHub**

1. **Copy Enhanced Code**: Export the enhanced component from V0.dev

2. **Replace Original Component**:

   ```bash
   # For Dashboard
   cp src/app/dashboard/page.tsx src/app/dashboard/page.tsx.backup
   # Paste V0.dev enhanced code into src/app/dashboard/page.tsx

   # For Agents
   cp src/app/agents/page.tsx src/app/agents/page.tsx.backup
   # Paste V0.dev enhanced code into src/app/agents/page.tsx

   # For Campaigns
   cp src/app/campaigns/page.tsx src/app/campaigns/page.tsx.backup
   # Paste V0.dev enhanced code into src/app/campaigns/page.tsx
   ```

3. **Restore Dependencies**: Add back any needed imports:

   ```typescript
   // Add these imports if removed by V0.dev
   import PageLayout from "@/components/page-layout";
   import { trpc } from "@/utils/trpc";
   import { useSession } from "next-auth/react";
   ```

4. **Reconnect Data**: Replace mock data with real tRPC calls:

   ```typescript
   // Replace mockCampaigns with:
   const { data: campaigns } = trpc.campaigns.getAll.useQuery();

   // Replace mockAgents with:
   const { data: agents } = trpc.agents.getAll.useQuery();
   ```

5. **Test Integration**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Visit http://localhost:3000 to test enhanced components
   ```
